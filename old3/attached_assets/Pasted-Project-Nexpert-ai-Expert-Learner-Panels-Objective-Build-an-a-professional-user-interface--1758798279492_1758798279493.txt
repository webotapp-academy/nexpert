UI Guidelines

Use TailwindCSS only.

Modern, minimal, and responsive.

Components should be modular (cards, forms, tables, modals).

Avoid JavaScript unless absolutely necessary for UI (e.g., dropdown, modal). Use Tailwindâ€™s utility classes.

Use placeholders where integrations (e.g., Razorpay, Calendar, Video call) would go.
