## ✅ Dynamic Path Fix Complete!

### What was done:

1. **Fixed session configuration paths** - The project now uses dynamic folder detection instead of hardcoded `/nexpert/` paths
2. **Updated all include statements** - All PHP files now use relative paths that work with any folder name
3. **Fixed API file paths** - All API endpoints now correctly detect the project root
4. **Updated path constants** - BASE_PATH and BASE_URL are now calculated dynamically

### Changes made:

- ✅ Updated `includes/session-config.php` to use dynamic BASE_PATH for cookie path
- ✅ Fixed all expert panel files (`expert/*.php`)
- ✅ Fixed all learner panel files (`learner/*.php`) 
- ✅ Fixed all admin panel files (`admin/*.php`)
- ✅ Fixed all API files (`admin-panel/apis/**/*.php`)
- ✅ Updated include statements to use `dirname(__DIR__)` instead of complex path calculations

### How it works:

The project now automatically detects its folder name using:
- `includes/config.php` - Calculates BASE_PATH and BASE_URL dynamically
- All files use relative paths like `dirname(__DIR__) . '/includes/session-config.php'`
- No more hardcoded `/nexpert/` references anywhere

### Testing:

You can now:
1. Rename your project folder from `nexpert` to any name (e.g., `my-app`, `learning-platform`, etc.)
2. The project will automatically work with the new folder name
3. All paths, cookies, and includes will be updated automatically

The error you encountered has been fixed - the problematic path calculation that was creating invalid paths like `C:/xampp/htdocsC:\xampp\htdocs\nexpert/includes/...` has been replaced with clean, working relative paths.
